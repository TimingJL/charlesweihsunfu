Of special interest are the historical connections made between China and Japan through Korea, especially through itinerant performers. Through these relationships Japanese shamanism has been influenced by Chinese and Korean shamanism. This legacy and heritage is still seen in Japan today and is also found within the tradition of Noh drama. Results of this study may help distinguish religious traditions in Japanese history, which have been difficult to separate.`}</div>
